# Photo-Gallery
This is a Photo Gallery in which different pictures has been put side by side and by clicking on the respective 
photos more related details will come in front.
In this I have added different species which are critically endangered, I want people to know about the species 
which they could not see in near future if they have not been provided proper care and environment.
This version is not mobile-friendly so open it in desktop for better quality.
